and so our ideas about liberation are all theoretical\nuntil we put them to practice, the practice of actually\nliberating.\n\nthere's stages right, we work through those things that personally\noppress us, opening us up to those things that socially oppress us,\nopening up further to what globally oppresses us.\n\nthe thing about your verse IMHO, is not that its so much about\npersonal liberation, but its about personal liberation from\noppression you chose to put yourself into. the trials and\ntribulation of fame... that was a choice. and in the scheme of\nthings you being a person fighting on that social/global level of\nliberation, you gotta expect that type of stuff. i'm talking here\nabout the hatred, the lack of faith in your ability to stay true,\nthe people that still see you as just another niggress no matter\nhow much you achieve. those are things you gotta expect signing the\ndotted line. and so i don't really want to hear about how hard that\nis for you. no offense. i know its hard. i know of many the artist\nthat has struggled with those issues, but its par for the course.\nnot something i see as being relevant to the discussion of social\nliberation. if you didn't want those things, you shouldn't have\nsigned on the dotted line, and found another way of achieving your\nmission.\n\n>what does it mean to liberate or be liberated ?\n\nat the end of the day only we can free we. we individually must\nfree ourselves from personal oppressors so that we collectively can\nfree ourselves from social oppressors, so that we can free\nourselves from global oppressors. you are among many trying to\nshare the light, but none of you are liberators.\n\n>QUESTION2:\n>whats the fundamental diff between my verse and andre's or\nbig\n>boy' s- besides mine being longer?\n\nfor one, neither of them are in this exchange. i would have\ncritique for dre as well (not worrying about what another nigga\nthink, is not liberation), less so for big boi. that said as i\nstated above the thing that set your verse apart is that its about\nan oppression you chose to put yourself into.\n\n>what else.\n\nany invalubale resources you found along the way in the education\nof your children?

By the years end I would have lost 2 close friends and 2\nfamily members. If it wasnt for a cd man,and a copy of mamas gun i\nwas finally able to cop i prolly would have lost my mind. The crazy\npart about it is that when I think of 2000 Mama's Gun is one of the\n1st memories that come to mind. It was just such an inspirational\nlp for real. I am sure you hear that 1000x a day and i didnt but it\njust brought back memories for me.\n\nI look forward to the new LP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mesg_id": 95100, "mesg_num": 280, "author": 162, "id": 390, "name": "Do you think you will do another live album?"}, {"signature": "___________", "date_time": "2007-11-19T13:29:00+00:00", "mesg_num": 282, "mesg_id": 95101, "text": "because ?uest would post here kind of implying\nthat it was done quickly", "author": 94, "id": 391, "name": "how long did yall (the Soulquarians) work on Mama's Gun?", "children": [{"signature": "XBL GamerTag: Tha End | PSN ID: KnowOne215", "date_time": "2007-11-19T13:39:00+00:00", "text": "lol", "mesg_id": 95102, "mesg_num": 285, "author": 163, "id": 392, "name": "^stole my question^"}, {"signature": "", "date_time": "2007-11-19T13:43:00+00:00", "text": "Wut it dew homegurl...\n\nU already know wut i think about ya....lol\n\nCant work to work with ya again!!!!! \n\nS1", "mesg_id": 95103, "mesg_num": 287, "author": 164, "id": 393, "name": "Waddup E!"}]}, {"signature": "XBL GamerTag: Tha End | PSN ID: KnowOne215", "date_time": "2007-11-19T13:39:00+00:00", "text": ";-)", "mesg_id": 95104, "mesg_num": 286, "author": 163, "id": 394, "name": "*just here 2 show sum luv*"}, {"signature": "", "date_time": "2007-11-19T13:54:00+00:00", "text": "I am so sad that I missed you on Girlfriends.\nI did catch you at the Carolina Music Festival.

I have struggled to negotiate being a\nmusical artist in an academic setting. Increasingly, I have\ngrappled with constructions of genre and categories as ways of\ntrying to explain or represent music, often obscuring the human\nrealities behind the art. Simultaneously, I struggle constantly\nwith the dilemmas of trying to produce music that can have a\npositive social impact. My personal interest has driven me to\npursue these questions in an academic forum. As an artist that I\nrespect and admire, one that does not fit easily into conventional\nboxes of genre, and whose song messages are both thought-provoking\nand socially important, I find you to be a compelling example\nthrough which to explore these subjects. This semester I have\nundertaken this exploration in the context of a project questioning\n\u201cNeo-soul\u201d as a genre. I give a lot of weight to\nartist\u2019s own representations of themselves, and though it is\noften necessary, I find it difficult at best to discuss musical\nartists without being able to hear many things in their own words.\nI have attached my proposal (which I threw together last minute)\nand I would really appreciate any comments or ideas that you can\noffer on these themes.\n\nPaper Proposal:\n\nKedar Massenburg, the president of Motown Records from 1997 to\n2004, coined the term \u201cNeo-soul\u201d to describe novel\ntrends emerging from the influences of hip-hop and jazz. The term\nhas come to represent a large body of work by a diverse group of\nartists (Erykah Badu, D\u2019Angelo, Meshell Ndegeocello, Jill\nScott, and others). The movement is characterized by hybridity and\ninnovative negotiations of genre conventions. Within this movement,\nthere is a great deal of collective projects and collaboration.\nBeneath the broad stroke of coherence uniting artists labeled as\nbeing a part of the \u201cNeo-soul\u201d movement, there is a\ngreat deal of diversity. There are radically different approaches\nto tradition, instrumentation, production, and live performance.\nMany artists active in this movement are using their music as a\nform of social critique and radical intervention in discourses on\nrace, sexuality, and gender. Collaborating artists often\nindividually promote strongly contrasting value systems. By\nexamining different approaches to musical experimentation,\ndivergent discourses on race, gender, and sexuality, debates over\nauthenticity and representation, and collaboration I am questioning\nthe coherence of \u201cNeo-soul\u201d as a movement and the\nlimits of this categorization.\n\nTo explore these questions I will rely on primary sources like\nmusical pieces, lyrics, liner notes, interviews, and music videos.\nIn addition I will look at secondary sources that take a\nmusicological and sociological perspective on this movement, such\nas Jeff Chang\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Stop Won\u2019t Stop: A\nHistory of the Hip-Hop Generation\u201d and Lori Burn\u2019s\n\u201cDisruptive Divas: Feminism, Identity and Popular\nMusic\u201d. I will be using Okayplayer.com as a source that\nrepresents an innovative blend of artist\u2019s personal accounts\nand commentary, news, fan and public perspectives, critical reviews\nand discussions. This forum represents an active online community\nthat connects fans and artists, and it will be an interesting place\nto study.\n\n", "mesg_id": 95315, "mesg_num": 600, "author": 259, "id": 596, "name": "RE: eryKAHBAdu gets THE LESSON"}, {"signature": "", "date_time": "2007-11-21T22:41:00+00:00", "text": "if she do...do you pass on kids clothes?
